üé¨ Movie Recommendation System ‚Äì Flask Web App using Collaborative Filtering : 
This project is a web application built using Python, Flask, and the Surprise library for building recommender systems. It provides personalized movie recommendations based on a user's past ratings and preferred genre. The recommendations are generated using collaborative filtering with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm.

Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to help users discover new movies they might enjoy by analyzing their historical preferences and genre interests. It demonstrates how recommendation systems work in practice, particularly using matrix factorization techniques like SVD.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Python ‚Äì Programming language used for data processing and logic.

Flask ‚Äì Web framework to create the user-facing application.

Surprise (scikit-surprise) ‚Äì For building the collaborative filtering recommendation model.

Pandas ‚Äì For handling and manipulating data.

HTML + Jinja ‚Äì Used to render dynamic content in the browser via Flask templates.

Features of the Application
üé• Sample Movie Ratings Dataset
The app uses a small set of sample data with users, movies, ratings, and genres. Each user has rated a few movies across different genres like Sci-Fi, Crime, Romance, and Telugu.

ü§ù SVD-Based Collaborative Filtering
The recommendation engine is built using the SVD algorithm from the surprise library. It learns latent patterns from the rating matrix and predicts ratings for unseen movies.

üéØ Genre-Based Filtering
Users can choose their preferred genre from a dropdown (e.g., Sci-Fi, Crime, Romance, Drama), and the app filters the recommendations accordingly.

üß† Personalized Predictions
When a user inputs their User ID, the app:

Identifies which movies they've already rated.

Filters out watched movies from the trending ones in that genre.

Predicts ratings for the remaining ones.

Sorts and returns the top 5 recommended movies.

üåê Clean Web Interface
The app has a simple form where users can enter their User ID and select a genre. Recommendations are displayed below the form after submission.

Advantages and Use Cases
Helps users discover new movies based on genre and past interactions.

Demonstrates how collaborative filtering works in a simplified way.

Perfect for academic use, demos, and extending into larger-scale recommender systems.

Could be integrated with larger datasets like MovieLens or IMDb.

Conclusion  : 
The Movie Recommendation System is a beginner-friendly, genre-aware, collaborative filtering engine served through a clean Flask web interface. With a simple user input and personalized results, it showcases the practical application of machine learning in building intelligent and responsive user experiences.
